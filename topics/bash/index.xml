      <description>Motivation My name is Chris, and I have a problem. Hi, Chris.
In all seriousness, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I would call it a problem but I am (admittedly) obsessive when it comes to efficiency in my every day life. Finding little ways to improve how quickly I can complete day-to-day tasks is a game that I constantly play. I realized recently that my morning routine of making breakfast follows the general principles of least-constrained optimization: toast starts first, then tea, then coffee (instant kettle FTW) because tea has to steep and toast has to, well, toast which takes the longest.</description>
