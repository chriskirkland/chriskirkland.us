Welcome to my new website powered generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), created by [spf13](https://github.com/spf13), with the theme [Blackburn](http://themes.gohugo.io/theme/blackburn/).  This will serve as both my professional webpage and semi-professional blog.  Professionally, the blog will follow my experiences working with OpenStack and developing in Python/Bash/Golang.  Additionally, I will probably blog about my time spent studying [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)).

For backgroud information, see the [About Me](/about/) page.
