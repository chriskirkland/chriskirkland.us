## About Me

My name is Chris Kirkland.

I lived on the East Coast of the US for the majority of my life (FL for 12 years, GA for 10 years, and NC for 3 years) but moved to Austin, TX in June 2015.  I have been married to my lovely wife Elizabeth since May 2012.

### Software Engineer

I'm an Engineer on the Cloud Foundation Services Performance Team at IBM.  Most of the time, I work on Nova/Heat/Keystone performance utilizing [Rally](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Rally) as our primary benchmark harness.  However, I have spent some time doing performance work for the BlueMix AutoScale service.  I'm very interested in Software/Development Automation and have experience working with Ansible.  I am primarily a Python developer but I'm working on become proficient in Golang through side projects.

You can find a copy of my CV [here](/KirklandResume.pdf).

### Math Nerd

Before joining IBM, I received an MS in Applied Mathematics (conc. Computation Mathematics) from North Carolina State University.  My research focus was Symbolic Computation and Algebraic Geometry.

### Barbershop Enthusiast

I've been singing barbershop since 2012 including 3 years of quartetting with Tucker Street (Raleigh, NC).  Currently, I am serving as assistant director and Lead section leader for [A Capella Texas](https://acappellatexas.org/).
My background is in traditional choral music and solo voice:  I sang in the [Mercer Singers](https://music.mercer.edu/choral/) during my undergrad and studied voice in my spare time.
